# Configs

A repository of my personal configuration files for various services so that
they are available on the various machines on which I find myself working.

## Philosophy

I would not reccomend copying these wholesale (though that's up to you to
decide) but I've found that I feel much happier knowing what each line in
my config file is doing, and adding new ones only when there is some behavior
that I'd prefer differently.

These files are certainly not the fanciest nor do they provide the best looking
result for your shell or tmux window, they are simply what I've found helpful
in my workflow.

If you're interested in these sorts of configs, certainly feel free to peruse
some of my files, I've tried my best to document them well enough for people to
look through the configs and determine if there subsets of the commands that
they would like for their own config files.
